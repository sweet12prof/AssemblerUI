# AssemblerUI
UI for demonstration of MIPS assembler

* The above repository consists of a WPF program written to test the MIPS assembler middleware.
* This comes as a development in the long term project of a compiler Construction.
* The assembler translates up to 15 instructions which make up a subset of the MIPS32 assembly, they include:
    
    * add                                   
    * addi                      
    * sub                                   
    * and                                    
    * or                                    
    * xor                                   
    * slt              
    * sll             
    * srl   
    * beq
    * lw
    * sw
    * j
    * jal
    * jr
  
  # USAGE
* The assembler discards any vertical white space
* With horizontal space, **Keep it to one space**, to avoid any bugs(Fixing it soon)
* Load the asm file and hit compile/run
* A hex file is generated in asm file directory after run
