# AssemblerUI
UI for demonstration of MIPS assembler

The above repository consists of a WPF program written to test the MIPS assembler middleware.
This comes as a development in the long term project of a compiler Construction.
The assembler translates up to 15 instructions which make up a subset of the MIPS32 assembly, they include:
  1. add
  2. addi
  3. sub
  4. and 
  5. or 
  6. xor
  7. slt 
  8. sll
  9. srl
  10. beq
  11. lw
  12. sw
  13. j
  14. jal
  15. jr
  
  # USAGE
* The assembler discards any vertical white space
* With horizontal space, **Keep it to one space**, to avoid any bugs(Fixing it soon)
* Load the asm file and hit compile/run
